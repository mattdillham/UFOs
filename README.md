# UFOs
In this project we were dealing with the topic of UFOs. We were prompted to make filters for date, city, state, country and shape of the sightings. First we replaced our handle click funtion and created an if-else statement to add filter data from the input. We then created a filter table. Then we implemented a d3 select all funtion. The result is a clean and functional webpage that allows you to filter the data to suite your needs. The purpose of this project was to make an interactive, filterable webpage about UFO sitings. The technologies used were VS Code, javascript, css, html and bootstrap. One reccomendation for further developement would be to add any pictures or videos associated with the sightings, no matter the quality, because anything is better than nothing when it comes to sparking imagination around UFOs.
